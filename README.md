# Car-Price-Prediction

How do you evaluate the apt Price for a second hand car?

You look at the number of years, the type of fuel, how many KMS it has run etc.

In this case study, your task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the Price of a car based on its specs.

In below case study I will discuss the step by step approach to create a Machine Learning predictive model in such scenarios.

### Flow of the case study is as below:
- Reading the data in python
- Defining the problem statement
- Identifying the Target variable
- Looking at the distribution of Target variable
- Basic Data exploration
- Rejecting useless columns
- Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
- Feature Selection based on data distribution
- Outlier treatment
- Missing Values treatment
- Visual correlation analysis
- Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
- Converting data to numeric for ML
- Sampling and K-fold cross validation
- Trying multiple Regression algorithms
- Selecting the best Model

### Reading the data into python

The data has one file "CarPricesData.csv". This file contains 1435 car prices data.

You can download the data required for this case study here

### Data description
The business meaning of each column in the data is as below

### Defining the problem statement:
Create a ML model which can predict the apt Price of a computer
### Target Variable: Price
Predictors: Age, KM, FuelType, CC etc.

1. Price: The Price of the car in dollars
2. Age: The age of the car in months
3. KM: How many KMS did the car was used
4. FuelType: Petrol/Diesel/CNG car
5. HP: Horse power of the car
6. MetColor: Whether car has metallic color or not
7. Automatic: Whether car has automatic transmission or not
8. CC: The engine size of the car
9. Doors: The number of doors in the car
10. Weight: The weight of the car
