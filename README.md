# Car-Price-Prediction

How do you evaluate the apt Price for a second hand car?

You look at the number of years, the type of fuel, how many KMS it has run etc.

In this case study, your task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the Price of a car based on its specs.

In below case study I will discuss the step by step approach to create a Machine Learning predictive model in such scenarios.

### Flow of the case study is as below:
Reading the data in python
Defining the problem statement
Identifying the Target variable
Looking at the distribution of Target variable
Basic Data exploration
Rejecting useless columns
Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
Feature Selection based on data distribution
Outlier treatment
Missing Values treatment
Visual correlation analysis
Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
Converting data to numeric for ML
Sampling and K-fold cross validation
Trying multiple Regression algorithms
Selecting the best Model

### Reading the data into python

The data has one file "CarPricesData.csv". This file contains 1435 car prices data.

You can download the data required for this case study here

### Data description
The business meaning of each column in the data is as below

### Defining the problem statement:
Create a ML model which can predict the apt Price of a computer
### Target Variable: Price
Predictors: Age, KM, FuelType, CC etc.

Price: The Price of the car in dollars
Age: The age of the car in months
KM: How many KMS did the car was used
FuelType: Petrol/Diesel/CNG car
HP: Horse power of the car
MetColor: Whether car has metallic color or not
Automatic: Whether car has automatic transmission or not
CC: The engine size of the car
Doors: The number of doors in the car
Weight: The weight of the car
